           <h1>Terms & Promotion Details</h1>
           <p>All promotions are real — we promise. But please don’t ask why some days we have sales and some days we don’t. We vibe with the universe, and the universe vibes back (sometimes).</p>
           <p>Discount codes must be used before they expire. If you miss it, that’s on you. Please don’t message us saying “can you reopen the code?” No, superstar, we cannot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ship">
            <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
            <p>We try to ship fast. Like speed-of-light fast.</p>
            <p>But sometimes life happens — rain, traffic, global chaos, or a random cat sitting on your package.</p>
            <p>Shipping times may vary, meaning:</p>
            <p>— Sometimes super fast ⚡</p>
            <p>— Sometimes slow like your crush leaving you on “seen.”</p>
            <p>We’ll do our best, and the rest is in the hands of destiny.</p>
            <p>If your package is delayed, please don’t panic. We’re not running away. We’re broke, we need you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="payment">
            <h1>Payment Terms</h1>
            <p>Pay however you like — card, bank transfer, e-wallet — as long as it’s not with “love” or “trust me bro.”</p>
            <p>Once payment is confirmed, we ship.</p>
            <p>Once shipped, we pray you’ll love it.</p>
            <p>If not… well, check the Return section below.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="return">
            <h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>
            <p>We only accept returns if:</p>
            <p>We send the wrong item (yeah, our fault — shocked? Us too).</p>
            <p>The product is unused, undamaged, and still looking fresh — don’t let it fight with your washing machine first.</p>
            <p>You request the return within a short reasonable time after receiving it — not 3 months later when Mercury is in retrograde.</p>
            <p>If all conditions are met, we’ll refund or replace it — as fast as humans on caffeine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cus-res">
            <h1>Customer Responsibilities</h1>
            <p>Please double-check your size, color, address, and overall life decisions before buying.</p>
            <p>We sell clothes, not telepathy.</p>
            <p>If you enter the wrong address or wrong phone number, the delivery guy will be confused, and we’ll be quietly disappointed.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <h1>Final Notes</h1>
            <p>By using this website, you agree to our Terms & Conditions — even if you didn’t read them <span>(it’s fine, nobody does)</span>. Just being here means you’re part of the deal.</p>
            <p>We try our best to keep everything smooth, functional, and drama-free. But if something breaks — the internet, the layout, or your patience — please breathe, don’t punch your device, and give us a moment to fix things.</p>
            <p>When you place an order, please double-check your size, color, mood, and life choices. We sell clothes, not miracles, so if you pick the wrong thing… yeah, that’s on you.</p>
            <p>And finally: enjoy the website, shop responsibly, and just know that if you decide to spend money here, we love you very much (in a professional, non-creepy way)</p>
